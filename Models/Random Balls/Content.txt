## WHAT IS IT?

Random Balls simulates a frictionless billiard table.

## HOW IT WORKS

The balls are drawn in green. They move in straight lines and bounce off the walls but not off of each other.  The center of mass is drawn in white and leaves a red trail.

## HOW TO USE IT

Select the number of balls to be used, then push SETUP.  Push GO to run the model.

## THINGS TO NOTICE

Watch how the center of mass moves for a while.  Is there a pattern?  Is there a region in the box that it stays within?

## THINGS TO TRY

Use the speed slider to watch the model in slow motion.  Also try fast forwarding it.

Run the model with a lot of turtles.  What happens to the motion of the center of mass?  Why?  Now run it with only a handful of turtles.  (Try it in slow motion.)  Now what happens and why?

Let the model run for a while.  What do you notice about how much time the center of mass spends at different distances from the origin (its frequency distribution)?

Push SETUP, then in the command center, enter:

ask balls [ set heading 60 ]

This points all of the turtles in the same direction.  What does the center of mass do now?  Try other headings.

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Presently the balls don't bounce off each other.  If they did, would it make a difference in the behavior of the center of mass?  Try it.
