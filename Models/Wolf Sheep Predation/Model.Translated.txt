## Tutorial
### Source
A biological species is a group of organisms that can <trigger=reproduction>reproduce</trigger> with one another in nature and produce fertile offspring .
### Spanish


### Source
A population is the number of organisms of the same <trigger=species>species</trigger> that live in a particular geographic area  at the same time , with the capability of producing fertile offspring .
### Spanish


### Source
An <trigger=ecosystem>ecosystem</trigger>  is said to possess ecological <color=blue>stability </color> (or equilibrium) if it is capable of returning to its equilibrium state after a perturbation (a capacity known as resilience) or does not experience unexpected large changes in its characteristics across time .
### Spanish


### Source
An ecosystem  or biome describes a single environment and every <color=green>living (biotic)</color> organism  and <color=#555555ff>non-living (abiotic)</color> factor  that is contained within it or characterizes it. An ecosystem  embodies every aspect of a single habitat, including all interactions between its different elements.

Extinction 
### Spanish


### Source
Extinction  is the dying out or extermination of a <trigger=species>species</trigger>. Extinction  occurs when species are diminished because of environmental forces (habitat fragmentation, global  change, natural disaster , overexploitation of species for human use ) or because of evolutionary changes in their members (genetic  inbreeding, poor <trigger=reproduction>reproduction</trigger>, decline in <trigger=population>population</trigger> numbers).

The second variation, the "<color=grey>sheep </color>-<color=#a07348ff>wolves </color>-<color=green>grass </color>" version explictly models <color=green>grass </color> in addition to <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> and <color=grey>sheep </color>. The behavior of the <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> is identical to the first variation, however this time the <color=grey>sheep </color> must eat <color=green>grass </color> in order to maintain their <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> - when they run out of <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> they die . One unit of <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> is deducted for every step a <color=grey>sheep </color> takes. Once <color=green>grass </color> is eaten it will only regrow after a fixed amount of time .

### Source
There are a number ways to alter the model so that it will be <color=blue>stable </color> with only <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> and <color=grey>sheep </color> (no <color=green>grass </color>). Some will require new elements to be coded in or existing behaviors to be changed. Can you develop such a version?
### Spanish


### Source
There are two main variations to this model. In the first variation, the "<color=grey>sheep </color>-<color=#a07348ff>wolves </color>" version, <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> and <color=grey>sheep </color> wander randomly around the <color=#654321ff>landscape </color>, while the <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> look for <color=grey>sheep </color> to prey on. Each step costs the <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> one unit of <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color>, and they must eat <color=grey>sheep </color> in order to replenish their <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> - when they run out of <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> they die . To allow the <trigger=population>population</trigger> to continue, each <color=#a07348ff>wolf </color> or <color=grey>sheep </color> has a fixed probability of <trigger=reproduction>reproducing</trigger> at each time  step. In this variation, we model the <color=green>grass </color> as "infinite " so that <color=grey>sheep </color> always have enough to eat, and we don't explicitly model the eating or growing of <color=green>grass </color>. As such, <color=grey>sheep </color> don't either gain or lose <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> by eating or moving.

Things to Try
### Spanish


### Source
This model explores the <trigger=stability,blue>stability </trigger> of <trigger=predator,#a07348ff>predator</trigger>-<trigger=prey,grey>prey</trigger> <trigger=ecosystem>ecosystems</trigger> . Such a system is called <color=red>unstable </color> if it tends to result in <trigger=extinction>extinction </trigger> for one or more <trigger=species>species</trigger> involved. In contrast, a system is <color=blue>stable </color> if it tends to maintain itself over time , despite fluctuations  in <trigger=population>population</trigger> sizes.
### Spanish


### Source
This variation is more complex than the first, but it is generally <color=blue>stable </color>. It is a closer match to the classic Lotka Volterra <trigger=population>population</trigger> oscillation models. The classic LV models though assume the populations can take on real values, but in small populations these models underestimate <trigger=extinction>extinctions </trigger> and agent-based models such as the ones here, provide more realistic results.
### Spanish


### Source
This variation produces interesting <trigger=population>population</trigger> dynamics, but is ultimately <color=red>unstable </color>. This variation of the model is particularly well-suited to interacting <trigger=species>species</trigger> in a <color=green>rich nutrient</color> environment, such as two strains of bacteria in a petri dish.

### Source
To further explore the model, click on any of the following topics.
### Spanish


### Source
Try adjusting the parameters under various settings. How sensitive is the <color=blue>stability </color> of the model to the particular parameters?
### Spanish


### Source
Try changing the <trigger=reproduction>reproduction</trigger> rules -- for example, what would happen if reproduction depended on <color=#b3b300ff>energy </color> rather than being determined by a fixed probability?
### Spanish


### Source
Try running the <color=grey>sheep </color>-<color=#a07348ff>wolves </color>-<color=green>grass </color> model variation, but setting <I>initial-number-wolves</I> to 0. This gives a <color=blue>stable </color> <trigger=ecosystem>ecosystem</trigger>  with only <color=grey>sheep </color> and <color=green>grass </color>. Why might this be <color=blue>stable </color> while the variation with only <color=grey>sheep </color> and <color=#a07348ff>wolves </color> is not?
